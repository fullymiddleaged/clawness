Clawness — git presence check (SessionStart).

If the project isn't under version control, this injects a short note into
context so Claude will *ask* the user whether to initialize git. It never runs
`git init` itself — hooks can't interactively prompt, and initializing version
control is the user's call. The note tells Claude to ask and to act only on
explicit confirmation.

Silent when git is present, when git isn't installed, in non-project locations
(home dir / filesystem root), or when disabled via CLAW_NO_GIT_CHECK. Fails open.
