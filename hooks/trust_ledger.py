"""
Clawness — skill/agent trust ledger (SessionStart).

Trust-on-first-use integrity for context-injected artifacts. On the first session
it records a fingerprint of the project's skills, sub-agents, slash-commands and
MCP servers silently. On later sessions, if any of those changed or appeared, it
injects a note so Claude surfaces the drift to the user (hooks can't prompt
directly) and points at ``clawness audit-skills``.

Silent on first run, when nothing trackable exists, in non-project locations, or
when disabled via CLAW_NO_TRUST_LEDGER. Fails open. Decision/scan logic lives in
``clawness/trust.py``.
