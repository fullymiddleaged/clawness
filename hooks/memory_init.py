Clawness — project memory bootstrap (SessionStart).

On the first session in a project, create `.clawness/memory.md` (the per-codebase
lessons-learned log that the UserPromptSubmit hook injects every turn) seeded with
a short how-to line, and inject a note so Claude tells the user once that the file
exists and how to use it ("remember this: ...").

Like git_check, this can't prompt the user directly — hooks only inject context,
and Claude relays it. It writes one small file the first time and is silent forever
after.

Gated to real projects: only inside a git work tree, never the home directory or
filesystem root, and never when CLAW_NO_MEMORY is set. If the file already exists
it stays silent. Fails open on any error — memory is a convenience, never a blocker.
