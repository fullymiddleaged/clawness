# Clawness Status

Show the user what's currently active in their Clawness setup.

> All commands below use `clawness`. If it isn't on PATH (common for a

> (`python3` on macOS/Linux) instead.

Keep this FAST — it's a quick health check, not a full scan. Step 1 already
proves retrieval at zero cost, so a test query is unnecessary.

## Steps

1. **Report the rules you already see (no command).** You (Claude) receive the
   Clawness rule block at the top of your context this turn. Summarize it: how
   many mandatory + relevant rules, and a few rule IDs. If you see it, injection
   is working — this alone is the health check.

   **If you do NOT see an injected block, say so plainly and do not rationalize
   it.** The hook injects the global rules on *every* prompt in *every*
   directory — the working directory (including being in the Clawness source
   repo) does **not** disable injection; it only affects the optional
   `.clawness/rules/` project overlay. A missing block means the hook is **not
   running** — either not loaded this session (needs a restart / `/reload-plugins`)
   or erroring (check `/hooks` and `claude --debug`). Never attribute a missing
   block to the current directory.

2. **Show the corpus + token cost.** Run (fast):
   ```bash
   clawness stats
   ```
   Report total rules, domains, and the `Tokens / turn` line.

3. **Project rules (only if present).** If `.clawness/rules/` exists in the
   project (walk up to the git root), mention it; otherwise skip silently.

**Summary** — keep it to a few lines:
- Rule injection: working (you saw the block) / not seeing rules
- Global rules: N across M domains; ~N tokens/turn (tune with `CLAW_TOP_K`, `CLAW_VERBOSE`, `CLAW_COMPACT`)
- Project rules: N, or "none — `clawness init .` to add some"

> If `clawness` isn't on PATH (plugin-only install), use `python -m clawness.cli ...`.
